# buildingModule
BNTA Day 12 <br />
JavaScript <br />
Created a 'building' class as a module to practise class and module concepts <br />
Also implemented logic statements do to with a person interacting with the building (person is inside/outside of building, can shut/open door, can pour glass of 'drink' only if they are inside the house and the door is shut etc.) <br />
Led nicely on to the CLI RPG game created in the next mini-project - see get_out repo for a CLI game written in JavaScript powered by Node.js <br />
