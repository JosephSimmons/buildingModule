# buildingModule
BNTA Day 12
JavaScript 
Created a 'building' class as a module to practise class and module concepts
Also implemented logic statements do to with a person interacting with the building (person is inside/outside of building, can shut/open door, can pour glass of 'drink' only if they are inside the house and the door is shut etc.)
Led nicely on to the CLI RPG game created in the next mini-project - see get_out repo for a CLI game written in JavaScript powered by Node.js
